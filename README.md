### What I learned

Wonderful recap on how to use CSS varibles: 

```css
:root {
  --primary-green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  --neutral-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --neutral-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  --neutral-dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  --neutral-off-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```

### Continued development

It would be great to have a small preview of each profile on hover, like the profile picture, name and maybe some specific information for each platform (like the number of contributions for GitHub, number of completed projects on Frontend Mentor, current job for LinkedIn, number of tweets for twitter and number of posts for Instagram).
